# 👋 Hi, I'm Thapelo Madiba Masebe (Cozisoul)

### 🪐 Transdisciplinary Artist, Data Scientist & Creative Technologist

---

I operate from a professional office, not a traditional studio, architecting systems to translate the unseen—abstract data, memory, and emerging African identity—into tangible forms. My practice is a duality of the **Systematic** (structured, data-driven analysis) and the **Poetic** (intuitive, aesthetic inquiry).

This GitHub is the technical foundation for that practice.

### 🏛️ Core Pillars of My Practice

My work is organized into four key pillars, each linking a core concept to active, public projects.

| Pillar | Core Concept | Key Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Transdisciplinary Art & Research** | `The Poetic` | **[tmm-creative-coding](https://github.com/Cozisoul/tmm-creative-coding)** |
| **Data Science & Machine Learning**| `The Systematic` | **[DataSciencePortfolio](https://github.com/Cozisoul/DataSciencePortfolio)** |
| **Scientific & Cosmic Analysis** | `Translating the Unseen` | **[CalibratingTheCosmos-UHF](https://github.com/Cozisoul/CalibratingTheCosmos-UHF)**|
| **System Architecture** | `The Office` | **[tmm-os](https://github.com/Cozisoul/tmm-os)** *(This OS!)* |
