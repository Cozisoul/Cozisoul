# 👋 Hi, I'm Thapelo Madiba Masebe (Cozisoul)

## 🪐 Transdisciplinary Artist, Data Scientist & Creative Technologist

I work at the intersection of **data, memory, and emerging African identity**—using art, code, and research to translate the unseen into tangible forms.

- 🎨 **Art + Code:** Exploring memory, identity, and cosmic aesthetics through generative systems and creative coding.
- 📊 **Data Science:** Applying structured analysis to practical problems while crafting systematic approaches to learning.
- 🛰️ **Radio Astronomy:** Building pipelines with MeerKAT data, translating cosmic signals into sound and visuals.
- 🛠️ **TMM-OS:** Developing a personal operating system to manage my life, art, research, and learning as a unified system.

## 🚧 Current Focus

✅ Completing the **Deviare Data Science Learnership** and `DataSciencePortfolio` uploads.  
✅ Building my **TMM-OS** (Personal Operating System + Dashboard) for daily operations and artistic research management.  
✅ Publishing **transdisciplinary projects** that merge art, data, and African futures.
